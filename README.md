# LogSphere

LogSphere is a scalable, distributed log collection and analysis system designed to support large-scale web services by centralizing log data from multiple servers worldwide. This repository provides a robust solution for real-time monitoring, error detection, and alerting to ensure high service reliability and efficient operations.

## Project Overview

As web services scale, the volume of log data grows exponentially. LogSphere enables centralized log aggregation, storage, and real-time analysis, allowing operations teams to quickly detect errors and monitor system performance. 

Key features include:

- **Log Collection**: Centralized log collection from distributed servers
- **Central Storage**: Partitioned and replicated storage for data reliability
- **Real-Time Data Analysis and Alerts**: Automated error detection and alerts
- **Fault Recovery**: Safe recovery and minimal data loss in case of failure

## System Architecture

The architecture comprises the following main components:

1. **Log Collection**
   - Each server streams log data to **Apache Kafka**.
   - Logs are organized by topic, e.g., "error logs" and "user activity logs."

2. **Central Data Storage**
   - **Cassandra** or **MongoDB** stores log data in a distributed manner.
   - Each log entry includes fields like `timestamp`, `log_level`, `message`, and `source`.
   - Data replication ensures reliability.

3. **Real-Time Data Analysis and Alerts**
   - **Apache Flink** processes log data in real time.
   - Alerts are triggered on critical log levels, and warning alerts are sent for threshold breaches (e.g., more than 100 error logs within a minute).

4. **Data Integrity and Transaction Management**
   - Transactions are used for critical data to maintain integrity.
   - **ACID** transactions ensure that modifications are consistent.

5. **Fault Recovery and Data Reliability**
   - **Write-Ahead Logging** protects against data loss during failures.
   - Logs are backed up in **HDFS** for long-term storage and analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Kafka
- Cassandra or MongoDB
- Flink
- HDFS (optional for backup)

### Installation


### Usage
Log Streaming: Use the Kafka producer to send logs from each server to the Kafka cluster.

### Example Log Structure
Logs are structured with essential fields for analysis:

- timestamp: When the log entry was generated
- log_level: Severity level (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- message: Log message details
- source: Origin of the log (e.g., server name)
  
### Expected Outcomes
- Real-Time Monitoring: Quickly detect errors and respond in real time.
- Data Reliability: Minimize log data loss during failures.
- Scalability: Flexible system scaling as log data grows.
- Operational Efficiency: Insight into system performance and user activity.
